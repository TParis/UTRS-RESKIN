			<p>You should receive an email shortly with instructions on how to verify your email address.  Your appeal will <strong>not</strong> be considered, or even viewed, until
			after you have verified your email address.  If you do not receive the email within 24 hours, check your spam or junk folder.  If you still have not received the verification email
			then send an email to utrs dash developers at googlegroups dot com.  Not that the UTRS developers box will <strong>not</strong> consider unblock requests.  It will only handle technical
			bugs related to the operation of the website.
